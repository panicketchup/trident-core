# =========
# Increase VFS read-ahead (better disk performance - particularly for SSDs)
# FreeBSD Default: 64
vfs.read_max=128

# maximum segment size (MSS) specifies the largest amount of data in a single TCP segment
# For most networks 1460 is optimal, but you may want to be cautious and use
# 1440. This smaller MSS allows an extra 20 bytes of space for those client which are on a
# DSL line which may use PPPoE. These networks have extra header data stored in
# the packet and if there is not enough space, must be fragmented over additional
# partially filled packets.
# Default: 536
net.inet.tcp.mssdflt=1440

# Loopback interface tuning
net.inet.tcp.nolocaltimewait=1 	#Do not create compressed TCP TIME_WAIT entries for local connections

# General Security and DoS mitigation.
net.inet.ip.check_interface=1 	# verify packet arrives on correct interface (default 0)
net.inet.ip.process_options=0 	# IP options in the incoming packets will be ignored (default 1)
net.inet.ip.random_id=1		# assign a random IP_ID to each packet leaving the system (default 0)
net.inet.ip.redirect=0 		# do not send IP redirects (default 1)
net.inet.icmp.drop_redirect=1 	# no redirected ICMP packets (default 0)
net.inet.tcp.always_keepalive=0 	# tcp keep alive detection for dead peers, can be spoofed (default 1)
net.inet.tcp.drop_synfin=1 	# SYN/FIN packets get dropped on initial connection (default 0)
net.inet.tcp.icmp_may_rst=0 	# icmp may not send RST to avoid spoofed icmp/udp floods (default 1)
net.inet.tcp.msl=15000 		# 15s maximum segment life waiting for an ACK in reply to a SYN-ACK or FIN-ACK (default 30000)
net.inet.tcp.path_mtu_discovery=0 	# disable MTU discovery since most ICMP type 3 packets are dropped by others (default 1)
net.inet.tcp.rfc3042=0 		# disable limited transmit mechanism which can slow burst transmissions (default 1)
net.inet.udp.blackhole=1 		# drop udp packets destined for closed sockets (default 0)
net.inet.tcp.blackhole=2 		# drop tcp packets destined for closed ports (default 0)
net.inet.tcp.reass.maxqueuelen=1448	# Relax the TCP reassembly queue length limit to improve performance in the event of packet loss or reordering.

## IPv6 Security
# Disable Node info replies (default 3)
net.inet6.icmp6.nodeinfo=0 		#Mask of enabled RF4620 node information query types
# Turn on IPv6 privacy extensions (default 0)
net.inet6.ip6.use_tempaddr=1 		#Create RFC3041 temporary addresses for autoconfigured addresses
net.inet6.ip6.prefer_tempaddr=1 	#Prefer RFC3041 temporary addresses in source address selection
# Disable ICMP redirect (default 1)
net.inet6.icmp6.rediraccept=0 		#Accept ICMPv6 redirect messages
